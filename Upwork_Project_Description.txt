UPWORK PROJECT DESCRIPTION FIELDS

====================================================
PROJECT SUMMARY (120-1200 characters, min 120)
====================================================

Production-ready NL-to-SQL analytics platform that turns plain-English questions into safe SQL, executes them on your PostgreSQL/MySQL database, and returns results with charts, exports, and explanations. Includes RBAC, JWT auth, rate limiting, caching, and fallback mode (works offline without LLM). Built with Flask, fully tested, documented, and secure by design.

====================================================
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (Optional, up to 5)
====================================================

Q1: Does this system work if I don't have an LLM API key?
A: Yes, fully. The system has a built-in fallback mode that generates SQL from templates and explanations from result rows. It works perfectly offline or when API quota is exhausted. You can enable DEV_FALLBACK_MODE=true in .env and never call the LLM. No external dependencies required for core functionality.

---

Q2: How is SQL injection prevented?
A: Multi-layer defense: (1) User input is never interpolated into SQL—only treated as a natural language question. (2) All SQL is generated by trusted code (LLM or templates). (3) A 13-point validator blocks forbidden keywords (INSERT, DELETE, DROP, etc.) and patterns (semicolons, comments, UNION). (4) Database enforces read-only sessions and 5-second statement timeouts. (5) No table names are exposed in error messages. Tested against 13 injection attack types—all blocked.

---

Q3: What database systems are supported?
A: PostgreSQL and MySQL are fully supported. The system uses SQLAlchemy, so it's extensible to other SQL databases (SQL Server, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). All code is database-agnostic except for minor session configuration. Default sample data is PostgreSQL; easy to adapt.

---

Q4: Can I control which users see which data?
A: Yes. Role-based access control (RBAC) is built-in. Define roles (analyst, finance, admin, etc.) and assign table-level permissions. Only authorized tables appear in the schema context sent to the LLM. Users see HTTP 403 if they request unauthorized data. Audit logs track who queried what. Fully configurable per your org structure.

---

Q5: How do I deploy this—cloud, on-premise, or my own server?
A: Flexible. The app is a standard Python Flask API (17 endpoints). Deploy to: (1) Heroku (easiest, free tier available), (2) AWS/Azure/GCP (with Gunicorn + reverse proxy), (3) Docker container, (4) Your own Linux/Windows server. I provide full deployment guides and CI/CD examples. Typically runs on a small VM with <1GB RAM for 10-100 users.

---

Q6 (BONUS): What's included in delivery?
A: Full source code (13 Python modules, frontend UI), SRS/SDD documentation, API documentation, security hardening guide, edge-case test suites (validated 24/25 scenarios), sample data (130 rows), deployment guides, and step-by-step setup instructions. Everything ready for production or further customization. GitHub-ready with no secrets exposed.

---

Q7 (BONUS): How much does it cost to run?
A: Minimal. Database hosting (PostgreSQL): ~$10-50/month (AWS RDS free tier available). LLM API (Gemini): Free tier includes 15K calls/month—enough for 500+ users per day. Or use fallback mode (zero API cost). Flask hosting: $0-50/month depending on provider. Total: Can run for free on trial tiers or ~$100/month for production setup with moderate usage.

COPY-READY SUMMARY (Paste to Upwork)
===================================================

I deliver production-ready NL-to-SQL analytics: ask questions in English, get safe SQL results with charts and explanations. Multi-layer security (RBAC, JWT, rate limiting, SQL injection prevention), smart caching, and works offline via fallback mode. Fully tested, documented, and extensible.
